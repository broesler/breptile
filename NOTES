# NOTEs for breptile.vim

Two options for each program (filetype):
1. Run entire script
2. Run just the selected lines/operator lines --> already functioning!!

No error reporting on just selected lines... use BReptile to send text to tmux

	-- Need to use :make + filter for error reporting for each function
	-- Can generalize "RunScript" function (and its mapping), and just pass
	   b:makeprg and b:errorformat for each filetype
	-- IDEA: separate "RunScript" and "GetErrors" functions! Allows for
	   long-running scripts, no hacks to wait for script to finish
	-- just use "tmux capture-pane -p -t . b:breptile_tmuxpane" to get
	   output, then choose option: 
		1. write vimscript to filter just most recent output, write
		   to errorfile, read in via ":cgetfile". This option doesn't
		   actually call ":make" ever, and is probably the most portable
		   since it does not rely on bash other than for the tmux
		   command (which we're assuming the user is already running!).
		   It does, however, require writing a temp file which could
		   introduce some portability issues.
		2. write bash script to output just most recent output in same
		   pane as vim (bash script will call tmux capture-pane), run
		   ":make myfilter" to get those errors into a quickfix list
	-- either way, 

Matlab:
  >> %:t:r (i.e. 'filename.m' => 'filename')

Gnuplot:
  gnuplot -p 'filename.gpi'
  OR
  gnuplot> load 'filename.gpi'

Bash:
  ./filename.sh

Python:
  ./filename.py

For all: need to cd into proper folder to run

Need to be able to set defaults (g:...) in ~/.vimrc
