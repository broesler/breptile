## BReptile

A vim plugin for running your [REP]ti[L]e programs without copy/paste.

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git@bitbucket.org:broesler/breptile.git

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with
`:help breptile`.
