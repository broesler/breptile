INTRODUCTION                                    *breptile*

Whenever you edit a file in a tmux session, a set of commands is defined that
serve as a gateway to a neighboring tmux pane. Additional functionality is
available based on filetype.

USAGE 						*breptile-usage*
COMMANDS                                        *breptile-commands*

These commands are local to the buffers in which they work.

                                                *breptile-:BReptileFindPane*
:BReptileFindPane {pattern}
			Find the pane in which {pattern} is running. {pattern}
			is a standard grep expression that will uniquely match
			the process name by which your REPL program is called.

                                                *breptile-:BReptileSendCount*
:BReptileSendCount {count}
			Send {count} lines to REPL program.

                                                *breptile-:BReptileSendRange*
:[range]BReptileSendRange
			Send {range} lines to REPL program.

BUGS 						*breptile-bugs*
	ISSUE [09/21/2016, 15:02]:
	-- Trouble with single quotes followed by a newline, but only when the
	single quoted line is in the middle of other lines, i.e.
		set title 'Simple Plots'
		set title  font "Times,20" norotate
	will work, giving this gnuplot output (in other tmux pane):
		gnuplot> set title 'Simple Plots'
		set title  font "Times,20" norotate
		gnuplot> set title  font "Times,20" norotate
		gnuplot>
	These commands:
		set samples 500, 500
		set title 'Simple Plots'
		set title  font "Times,20" norotate
	however, will give an error:
		gnuplot> set samples 500, 500
		set title 'Simple Plots'
		set title  font "Times,20" norotate
		gnuplot> set title 'Simple Plots'set title  font "Times,20" norotate
		                                 ^
		         unexpected or unrecognized token
		
		gnuplot>
	The same issue occurs whether using "<Leader>e2j" or "V2j<Leader>e" (and
	vice versa with the working lines of code).
	The following carriage return does not get parsed properly. 

	This issue appears to occur only occasionally, and seems to be
	a vim/shell timing issue. If we include "sleep 1" in the vimscript
	between each "system()" command (i.e. the literal keys, then the C-m,
	then the next set of literal keys in the next for-loop iteration, etc.),
	the problem disappears entirely.

	NOTE: The same problem occurs with "tmux load/paste-buffer". Entire
	description is posted to a StackOverflow question here
	<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39646008/why-does-tmux-not-insert-newlines-when-pasting-a-multi-line-command>
	
	In general, we need to double quote the vim string that we pass to
	shellescape(), so that single quotes get properly escaped, i.e. 
		:echom shellescape('test') 
			'test'
		:echom shellescape("'test'") 
			'\'''test'\''' 
	We need to use single quotes around the "keystrokes" string, however, so
	that shell expansion does not occur when we send the string to tmux:
		$ test=hi
		$ tmux send-keys -t left -l 'echo $test'
		[left] 	$ echo $test
		$ tmux send-keys -t left -l "echo $test"
		[left] 	$ echo hi
