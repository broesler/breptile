INTRODUCTION                                    *breptile*

Whenever you edit a file in a tmux session, a set of commands is defined that
serve as a gateway to a neighboring tmux pane. Additional functionality is
available based on filetype.

COMMANDS                                        *breptile-commands*

These commands are local to the buffers in which they work.

                                                *breptile-:BReptileFindPane*
:BReptileFindPane {pattern}
			Find the pane in which {pattern} is running. {pattern}
			is a standard grep expression that will uniquely match
			the process name by which your REPL program is called.

                                                *breptile-:BReptileSendCount*
